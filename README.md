# Data Structures and Algorithms – Course Project (ES0207)


## Overview

This project was part of the **ES0207 Data Structures and Algorithms** course, focusing on both classical and modern algorithmic paradigms. We explored a wide range of algorithms in graph theory and combinatorial optimization, including randomized algorithms, greedy heuristics, and graph traversals. The codebase features clean implementations and well-commented logic for each algorithm.


## Key Concepts Explored

### Randomized Algorithms
- **Karger’s Min Cut Algorithm**  
  Randomized contraction algorithm to estimate the minimum cut of an undirected graph.

- **Polynomial Identity Testing**  
  Used randomness to verify if two polynomials are identical without expanding them fully.

---

### Greedy Techniques & Geometry
- **Greedy Set Cover**  
  Approximated solutions to NP-hard problems using greedy strategies.

- **Convex Hull (Graham Scan & Jarvis March)**  
  Constructed the convex polygon enclosing a set of 2D points using geometric sorting.

---

### Graph Algorithms

- **Shortest Path Algorithms**:
  - `Dijkstra's Algorithm` – Efficient single-source shortest paths using priority queues.
  - `Bellman-Ford Algorithm` – Handled graphs with negative edge weights.

- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:
  - `Prim's Algorithm` – Greedy edge selection from a priority queue.
  - `Kruskal's Algorithm` – Edge sorting with disjoint-set union to avoid cycles.

- **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)**:
  - Optimized with **path compression** and **union by rank** for efficient set merges.
